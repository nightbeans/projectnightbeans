        <p>News of Mr Armitage’s death made its way back to Mrs Careen from Wesley swiftly since she’d been making calls to inform Mr Armitage of Conor’s return. He told her what had happened, and she instructed him to return Calum as soon as they’d buried the great man. She knew he’d be as happy laid on their land as he would on his own. They buried him that day, and Wesley escorted Calum home. He wished to see the field where Mr Armitage had raised and paid tribute to his girls.</p>
        <p>He stayed for a few weeks, stayed for the planting. Showed Calum and Conor how to plant the three sisters. Mrs Careen noted how the pair of them mirrored this man exactly, even better than Calum’s Armitage impression. She wished he’d stay to help the boys, but only time would test their trouble. He reminded her of Mr Armitage, but more present in his body, fuller somehow.</p>
        <p>Wesley knew he had to return for the planting on his own land. He had agreed with many of the townsfolk to plant the three sisters this year in memory of their old friend and guardian, in an attempt to reclaim some of the traditions he’d loved and to tie them once again to their history and stories. The only protection they had against the warlord, who continued to make his silent offers whenever he travelled in his deep.</p>
