        <p>Epilogue</p>
        <p>Conor watched as the man without eyelids stood. Eyes off him, he turned from the room and down the stairs. He noted his careful steps as he walked behind him. Seeing him, a man a similar size to Mr Armitage was strange. He cut so graceful a figure as he wandered out into the night. Conor turned away, moved through the hedge-hole of Number Seven and again into Mrs Careen’s pristine garden. He checked his fathers watch, it was half eight in the evening. He saw the light of her rear room on and approached. All the curtains were closed, no visitors appeared welcome, but he had nowhere else to go.</p>
        <p>He knocked on the door. She sounded panicked.</p>
        <p><em>“No, no thank you\! No, no\!”</em></p>
        <p>Conor replied \- <em>“Hi, Mrs Careen, it’s Conor from Number Three.”</em></p>
        <p>He heard commotion as she threw whatever was on her lap to the ground and grasped for the key. After some fumbling, she unlocked the door and slammed it an inch into the chain latch. Shut it again and a moment later reached for him, immediately stopping herself before she held the boy as she realised she had no depth of relationship from which to hug him. But the boy wanted nothing more than to be held. As soon as his right hand stretched out slightly and upturned she saw what he needed, bent down and wrapped her arms around him.</p>
