        <p>A moment later the neighbour leant over the top rail of the staircase looking straight down at her. The faint moonlight reflecting from a cracked curtain and the glow of green scurrying out from under the antechamber married in her eyes. She was remarkable.</p>
        <p>Ella saw something quite different. The neighbour made his way to the top of the stairs and Ella saw it. His stomach seemed to be rippling, almost like she could see the day's food, some still tinned, moving through his body. It was like his skin was too tight and his innards were about to burst out and run down the stairs towards her. Too much to be just today's food. It was everything he’d ever eaten. He was moving towards them now. <em>Full</em>. She knew Conor could see it too, beside her now. Ella gently squeezed the handle of her knife, the slightest nick would cause the man to burst. Not something she wanted to see.</p>
        <p><em>“Are you satisfied with your choice?”</em> Called out the man without eyelids from the waiting room, <em>“retrieve them for me.”</em></p>
        <p>Ella reached back for Conor, grabbing him by the forearm before lunging forwards, blade straining. It slid in easily through the flesh and muscle above his right hip and they followed.</p>
