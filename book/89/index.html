        <p>Wesley concluded the gathering, making the final note that they would reconvene the following Wednesday evening, again at seven, where he would begin to take the council again through the first of the stories marked by his wampum. There was much shaking of hands and hugs as those in attendance thanked Mr Armitage for helping return them to their identity and reminding them of their position in the council of the five tribes. Many touched the head of Calum, who for some reason would clench his fists tight and squeeze his entire body when they did so, so as to try and make his newly discovered orenda as big as possible. At one point he was squeezing so hard he went red and got a little bit dizzy.</p>
        <p>The three of them began walking back to Wesley’s beside Hemlock Creek. Calum was asking Wesley every question he could about Thadodaho. About whether you can somehow kill or defeat the warlord, it seemed to him that would be exactly what he would want? Mr Armitage was silently revelling in their conversation. A young one \- asking an elder about their legends \- this victory had been hard-won.</p>
        <p>Then, running behind them, the woman appeared.</p>
        <p><em>“May I accompany you gentlemen home?”</em> She asked.</p>
        <p>Wesley wrapped his arm around her, Calum realising before he said it by the look in their eyes \- a look he’d seen shared by Ella and Conor many times \- that they were siblings, replied, <em>“yes my beautiful sister, nothing would delight me more.”</em></p>
        <p>Wesley’s great arm wrapped around her, she turned left to Mr Armitage. Calum noticed that she squinted at him a lot, like she saw something crawling beneath his skin, and asked \-</p>
        <p><em>“Armitage, a man of simple means. Why does it always seem as though your mind is so full? It is as though you hear nothing unless you’ve made space first.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“Is it not that way with everyone?”</em></p>
        <p><em>“No, not usually.”</em> She replied.</p>
        <p><em>“I don’t think that’s fair, Mary, most people aren’t good listeners, and yes, I have a lot of memories. I have a lot of memories and I think about them. What’s wrong with that?”</em></p>
        <p>The tone of his final question betrayed his frustrations. He’d hoped to carry the conversation with levity and have her questions pass quickly. He knew Mary, this lapse would keep her on him.</p>
        <p><em>“Good memories?”</em> She asked.</p>
        <p><em>“Many good, some less so. As you’d hope for in a life.”</em></p>
        <p>She was silent for a moment then. Just long enough for Mr Armitage to relax again.</p>
        <p><em>“What do you remember of the night the girl's mothers died?”</em></p>
        <p>As always he felt the air leave his lungs. He felt himself pull inwards. He felt the river begin pulling him back towards his field, before it diverged. Every deep has a river, tonight, his was Hemlock Creek.</p>
        <p>—</p>
        <p>Conor watched as Ella had taken the hands of their mutual friend. He saw how he must have passed into Ella in the bloody diamond. A river running into the sea. It was just him and his old friend now. The man who paid his fares. The neighbour lay beside him, perfectly still. He spotted a watch on his wrist, prodded at the sleeve to see it more clearly. It was the same as his fathers, the one Ella had given him. He unclipped the clasp and slid it off the man's arm and onto his own. Clamped it shut. He’d give it to his brother.</p>
        <p><em>“Where is Calum?”</em> He asked.</p>
        <p><em>“I don’t know boy, would you believe I’ve never met the lad.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“Thank fuck for that.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“Come Conor, be fair.”</em></p>
        <p>Conor paused for a moment then. Thought of the hound in the neighbours deep.</p>
        <p><em>“You’re a wolf.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“Ah Conor, Bedgellert is a beautiful town but I reject your allegory. There are many wolves. And many babes lie gored and dead in their mouths. Don’t play some Llewellyn now. Your sister \- is she supposed to be the brave and misunderstood hound? The truth is rarely as simple as a folktale.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“So what then?”</em> Cried Conor in desperation. The eyes staring back at him with great warmth. He could tell the man did love him, however inexplicably.</p>
        <p><em>“You all remind me of Llewelyn. So passionate. Passionate and wrong.”</em></p>
        <p>—</p>
        <p>Ella was running. Just ahead of her were Sara and Bethany. They were sprinting. <em>Fuck, they’re fast</em>, she thought. One slow breath. Then she tipped her chest forward a little, drove her knees high with each step and began gaining on them. She could smell the smoke before she could see it. They broke through the tree line and ran right. They turned onto a dirt road. The girls were not slowing. Ella knew she didn’t need to stay right on them, their destination marked by the roaring flames above the house in the distance. But she stuck with them regardless. <em>It’s always a race</em>.</p>
        <p>Sara and Bethany won. They stood fifty metres away, watching the inferno and the flames like horrid tongues licking around the edge of the basement door. Five steps leading down to it. <em>Infamous</em>, thought Ella, <em>these must be the gates of hell.</em> Watching these two girls gaze upon the collapsing building that housed the remains of their mothers, she realised finally and completely that Conor and Calum would never forgive her. She’d silently assumed the three of them were alone. Then, a familiar voice away to their right, knees in the dirt \-</p>
        <p><em>“Where is my Catherine?”</em></p>
        <p>Sara ran at him, her knee came flying and crashed into his temple as he crumpled awkwardly. Lay there, blood pouring from the wound, he smiled at her, as she grabbed a handful of soil and began jamming it down his throat.</p>
