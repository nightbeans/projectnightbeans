        <p>Conor only fully realised the strangeness of his surroundings, not when he saw the odd jungle that surrounded him, but when his head had emerged from the water and his breathing hadn’t changed. It wasn’t like he’d been breathing under water. It wasn’t really like he was breathing at all. But Ella was, quite heavily in fact. Pacing to and fro in the clearing where they had emerged.</p>
        <p><em>“We did it, Con, we fucking did it.”</em></p>
        <p>Conor didn’t speak. This was one of those times when questions would yield fewer answers than silence. Ella looked at him. He regarded the slight blue hue and swelling on her forehead where he had struck her before turning away, back to Ella’s river, trying desperately to make sense of it. She turned aside and began climbing a tree. Ascending with ease, she soon found a branch where she lay back, draped her legs over the sides and looked up at the canopy.</p>
        <p>Conor, usually so comfortable with silence, found himself wrestling his tongue. As she basked in a great victory, he sat - waiting for some indication of what this creature wanted next.</p>
        <p><em>“You’re in my deep, Con, I managed to get you in.”</em></p>
        <p><em>Not yet</em>, thought Conor, <em>don’t speak.</em> She continued gazing at the canopy. A minute passed. Finally -</p>
        <p><em>"You remember Mr Armitage's girls?"</em> She asked.</p>
        <p><em>"Yes, I remember his girls."</em></p>
        <p><em>"You remember when they disappeared? The police questioned him of course but he hadn’t even been in the country. You were what then? Six?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Seven."</em> Conor corrected.</p>
        <p><em>"It changed him completely. I spent as much time with him as I could. At first he couldn't bear to have me there. But he said I reminded him of Sara. So one day he unlocked the back door and never locked it again."</em></p>
        <p><em>"But how do you know they're down here?”</em></p>
        <p><em>"I never said they were down here with me, Con. I wouldn't need you for that. I brought you to prove we could get to them, in his deep.”</em></p>
