        <p>Calum felt weak hands awkwardly slip into his armpits; they tried to slide him in. The hands readjusted and attempted to reach under him, lifting him a fraction before giving up and laying him down again. The boy opened one eye and looked up at the gashed chin with the adhesive plaster half pulling away.</p>
        <p><em>“Please come in, I said, Goddamnit,”</em> said the neighbour, visibly frustrated - <em>“I’m not going to carry you.”</em></p>
        <p><em>Can’t,</em> Calum corrected him in his mind. Suddenly, a pen pierced a hole in the cup of fear he was carrying. It began to drain. He turned towards the green; for some reason, the floor remained safest, so he scooted in on his bottom. The neighbour turned and was evidently displeased by this, but made no effort to restrict him from doing so.</p>
        <p><em>“I, I’m Calum,”</em> he said.</p>
        <p><em>“So I’ve heard.”</em></p>
        <p>Calum continued, <em>“I’m sorry about your chin.”</em> The neighbour let out a deep grunt at that. Cleared his throat.</p>
        <p><em>“I’m sorry about your father,”</em> he replied, <em>“and brother.”</em> They both paused - <em>“sister too, I suppose”</em>. Calum wished he hadn’t mentioned the sea-snake; she made him feel cold, and he felt himself run his hands through his hair, checking everything was where it should be.</p>
        <p>Calum had no tact for the moment and no time to pretend that any would help get what he needed. He knew that Mr Armitage and Mrs Careen were too terrified of what might be too much for him to see that he may never find out the forces that led to the destruction of his family. He was thankful Mr Armitage had said no, since his greatest advantage was that this man had no cause to care for niceties. It was his cruelty that might give Calum exactly what he needed. He opened his mouth to ask about the disappearances of the three sisters, but as he went to, a wiser voice called up and through him. <em>Thanks, Con.</em></p>
        <p><em>“Mr Armitage’s girls, the three sisters. What happened to their mothers?”</em></p>
