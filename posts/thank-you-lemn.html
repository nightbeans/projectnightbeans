                <p>Lemn Sissay’s memoir of his childhood “My Name is Why” was excellent. There’s one page, I shan’t ruin it, but I will say I made special effort to read every word. A 5 word sentence repeated 91 times. It is the centre of the book. As I read the page it stood on, I hoped it would remain with me. I have thought about it again several times in the past two days. The sentiment it expresses is perfectly unique to the story he is telling, while remaining universal.</p>

<p>What he describes in that passage is so important I would do a grand disservice to it in explaining it.</p>

<p>Read his story, its likely to illumine something of your own.</p>
