                <p>One day I will be a father. For as long as I can remember I have had an assurance that undertaking that role will be the greatest part of my life. I think about it so often. Its strange but I feel like I love my children already. My heart yearns for them desperately. I dread to think what I may write when they are eventually here with me - as my heart bursts open with such a great love. </p>

<p>I believe myself somewhat cognizant of what fatherhood will entail, yet utterly naive to all its realities. I can comprehend that the child will bring with it a great many sleepless nights, frustration and fear of damage caused by my own inability to control my temper at times. I am also aware that there will be times when I will be utterly swept along by the bubbling up of joy that they will inevitably bring.</p>

<p>The one thing I know for certain is that that world - the world in which I am a father - I know nothing of it. But it brings me great joy to dream it.</p>

<p>You see, I feel very similar at 30 as I did at 20, and further back. I struggle to not play silly made-up games even in public. I can be quite a nuisance, dancing up and down the aisles on the weekly shop. Even when I was a teenager I would walk down the streets by my parents house and dance and sing aloud songs from West Side Story and pretend I was one of the Sharks or one of the Jets. In fact I would pretend I was <strong>all</strong> of Sharks and <strong>all </strong>of the Jets. </p>

<p>These things to me are not childish. I know my responsibilities and I endeavour to keep them. I am learning how to listen, how to communicate with others, how to navigate conflict. </p>

<p>I am <em>also </em>keeping those joyful avenues clear and open - both for my own silly enjoyment - and so I can easily join my wife and children in grand imagined worlds and quiet, calm nights doing <em>our </em>traditions. My wife’s imagination is vivid and wonderful. I can’t wait to see where she takes us all.</p>

<p><em>There is a forest in your mind,<br>you traverse it with your friends.<br>Some real, more imagined.<br>Up you go and see it’s expanse,<br>green as far as you can see.<br>There are glades of bluebells,<br>old logs teeming with life.<br>You build a fort among them,<br>as the stories tell themselves.<br>You are so many people,<br>and where you are is so many places.<br>You set fires after dark, some warm you,<br>others you fight to keep from spreading.<br>Most nights are beautiful with the stars,<br>other nights you cannot see them,<br>when you daren’t look up.<br>One day someone joins you,<br>when its time to take down the sticks.<br>In their place you lay bricks.<br>It is a sweet place, still among the bluebells.<br>You go the forest together every day,<br>the entire woodland is new now.<br>You go up and look again and it stretches further,<br>further than you recall. <br>You should tend it well, but remember,<br>it isn’t a garden. It’s a forest. <br>It is beautiful in the glade<br>of bluebells.<br>I hope to take you there one day<br>and I dream of the forest<br>you’ll bring with you.</em></p>
