                <p>You should own a domain. Pay a reasonable amount for it so it feels like it matters. Let the domain name be as close as possible to your own name. Allow me to explain why as I fight the urge to turn this into a grand-standing, self-righteous rant on the evils and non-necessity of social media. Suffice to say - just get off them, get off them all.</p>

<p>We are buying our first home, Rachel and I. The other day the solicitors sent us an email asking us to review the boundary line. I was overjoyed. Our boundary! That little red line showing the tiny corner of this planet that we will own. When you see your boundary, you don't think about keeping people out, but welcoming people in. I imagined the food we would share together, watching movies, summers with friends in our private garden. I thought again about the family we will eventually raise there. The joy of a boundary is the opportunity to bring an outsider inside.</p>

<p>Social media is for renters. The internet remains its own vast nation. If you have not purchased your own land, you cannot complain about the rules set by your landlords.<br>Get yourself a boundary line and start a blog. This blog is the start-point of a load of conversations we <em>could</em> have together. It is the space where I collect my thoughts in a different mode, in a way I deem fit for public consumption. It is also a bank of stories and pieces I can share with friends when I think something I've written might be able to help empathise with what they are going through.</p>

<p>It is not enough to just 'get off social media'. It must be replaced with something, since at its core its a beautiful thing, at its best serving to connect us with each other in sincerity and reality. We ought not rent a room from one of these platforms we all complain about but remain tied to. So why don't you get a blog, with the intention of reaching no more than 10 of those closest to you. I have my people in mind, those whom I would cherish to see their posts in my inbox.</p>

<p>Get your land, tell me the address and I will visit you there. You should get your own boundary lines wherever you can, so you can invite people in. Get a blog and write.</p>

<p>Little red line<br>makes it mine.<br>I have the bank<br>to thank.</p>
