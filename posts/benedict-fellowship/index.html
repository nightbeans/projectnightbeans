                <p>We have our first member. Last night I took my seat for a drink with a friend. Two minutes later he walked in. We grabbed a beer and sat back down. He reached in his pocket and carefully retrieved a sealed plastic baggy. What precious loot was this? This first follower handed me an egg and took his place as a member of the Benedict Fellowship. </p>

<p>We are committed to becoming the body that you consult when you want to decide where to go for brunch. The role of a Benedict Fellow is to identify and rank eggs benedicts by the corresponding index (EBI), the final structure of this ranking system is still under construction. If you can assist with this, please contact me.</p>

<p>If you would like to be considered for admittance to the Benedict Fellowship, the application is this - give me an egg.</p>
