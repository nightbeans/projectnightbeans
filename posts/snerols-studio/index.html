                <p>“<em>Was it justified this time?”</em> Mrs Greene asked as she entered her classroom. Before Nodnarb had chance to answer she continued, <br /><em>“You’ll both need to move on, the year eights will arrive any moment</em>.” </p>

<p>They escaped out the side door to the next base. There was a dance studio on the third floor. The two of them knew the schedule of classes that took place there off by heart. It was free. It was always safest a while after most people had cleared off campus but they both knew they needed to just move. This was the only place they had to really do that. </p>

<p>The sound system in there was as good as you’d imagine. Neither of them minded the wall of mirrors. They had no training but they just put on ‘<em>Solsbury Hill</em>’ by Peter Gabriel and began to spin and run around. They began to make themselves big.</p>

<p>Snerol especially loved to dance. He was aware that Nodnarb did it primarily to make it comfortable for him, he didn’t mind. ‘<em>You’ll Be In My Heart</em>’ from Tarzan clicked on. Man he loved Phil Collins too, each drumbeat and he would punch out a different limb. Reaching. He stretched up, stretched out, closed his eyes and just pushed with all his might. It started to bulge and give a little. It always did. He kept pushing, a drum fill hits and he strikes each one. It’s giving more.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and caught sight of himself in the mirror, he was far bigger now. He stretched up again, nearly hitting the lights above him. His eyes seemed even brighter green than usual, he felt them warming him. The whole room was larger now, his punches blasted the walls out, the mirrors doubled, the door blew off its hinges. He closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>The song slowed and he came to a stop.<br />“<em>Shall we go?”<br />“Sure” </em>replied Nodnarb.<em> </em></p>
