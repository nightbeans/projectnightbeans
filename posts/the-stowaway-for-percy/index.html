                <p>I just wanted an adventure. <br />I should not have been there. <br />Hiding below. <br />Thank God he cared for me. <br />Trapped with hope, <br />until it sinks. <br />So too I. <br />Thank God he cared for me. <br />I was not planned for. <br />No supplies, no bed, <br />no role reserved. <br />Thank God he cared for me. <br />We carried the Caird. <br />My feet frozen through, <br />the stowaway now useless. <br />Thank God he cared for me. <br />He sailed as we waited. <br />Inhospitable refuge. <br />I was in agony. <br />Thank God he cared for me. <br />There because I had hidden. <br />He acted as if I were chosen. <br />He fed me. <br />He led me. <br />He returned for me. <br />Thank God he cared for me. </p>
