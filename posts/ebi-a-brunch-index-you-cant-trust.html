                <p>Here’s the vision. You’re in Barcelona. You wake up naturally at 9:17. You have a shower and put on your Birks, shorts and a short sleeve shirt with one more button undone than your comfy with and head out the door.</p>

<p>You’re brunching.</p>

<p>You’re a brunch person now.</p>

<p>You’re a European brunch seeker.</p>

<p>So you search: <em>“where’s good for brunch near me?”</em></p>

<p>The highest bidder tells you: <em>“we are!”</em> So off you go.</p>

<p>This isn’t what you want. What you really want is a brunch index. You want all the potential eateries measured on one dish. A dish that needs attention for each serving without needing complete obsession. </p>

<p>Hollandaise sauce and two perfect poached eggs. It can’t be ignored. This is the core of an eggs Benedict then that can be appalling or absolutely glorious, but the dish also invites more. Beyond the core is room for so much innovation. The best eggs Benedict I ever had was on a potato rosti. A rosti!</p>

<p>Deciding where to brunch based on the eateries best able to serve a great eggs Benedict doesn’t mean you need to eat the eggs Benedict there, it just means you would finally have what you always wanted – a brunch index you can trust.</p>
