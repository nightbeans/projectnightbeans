                <p> I missed the golden age of blogs and I am not interested in social media. I am sure I would enjoy social media at its best but I think its presently happy with infamy. But man, we breezed through the era of the blogosphere. Straight through. Sad.<br>I have an immense love for blogs as an idea. They seemed like one of the best things we could do with the internet and I think we may have squandered it. Admittedly, I don’t know much about them and maybe the blog-type sites today are ‘Medium’ or ‘Substack’, but I don’t know about those platforms, so here we are.</p>

<p>I had two paragraphs here but I accidentally deleted them. I had written that maybe what I really want is a journal. I said that because I had written that I didn’t want to have to post a photo with what I’d written. I didn’t want to have to make a video to accompany what I thought because it would be good content. I just want to write things down.</p>

<p>So that’s why I said it’s likely that I just want a journal.</p>

<p>But in the spirit of reclaiming my creative corner of the internet, here’s the blog rules:<br />1) I am allowed to change my mind. I do not wish to be held to what I write here to a level that exceeds my willingness to change my mind.<br />2) I will write about whatever I want. The blog is for me and I’ll do what I want with it.<br />3) No photos, graphics or links.</p>

<p>I am hoping to write about all kinds of things. I will write about my faith here but I think I’ll leave that unpublished.</p>

<p>I hope this practice will make me a better writer and help me learn what I sound like.</p>
