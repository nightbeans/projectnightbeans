                <p>This definitely comes up a lot. </p>

<p>It’s probably more front and centre for me because I have grown up with my Dad in church leadership, I’ve seen my fair share of him and my Mum walking with families and individuals through seemingly insurmountable challenges. I’ve seen them walk through their own, though I’ve mostly heard about the mires they walked through themselves after the fact. </p>

<p>Of course my parents have always shielded us from the horrors those they lead have experienced, both self-inflicted torment and plenty utterly undeserved and unprovoked. </p>

<p>I am aware that life can turn on a dime. Everything could move along fine, we could build an excellent frame for our life to sit in. </p>

<p>Fire is an apt metaphor, something beautiful could be ashes by this time tomorrow. </p>

<p>Water is an apt metaphor, we are unknowably complex organisms, but submerge us in water and we shut up shop pretty quick. </p>

<p>So I walk around trying to set out of mind that a misstep could send my life and the lives of those I love crumbling to the ground. If I dwelt on it too long I think I’d stop being able to do anything. Or I’d run from distraction to distraction restlessly jabbering on through shallow breaths. </p>

<p>The Bible says that the enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy. <br />The Bible also says that Jesus came that we may have life and have it more abundantly.</p>

<p>Your life is a constrained expanse. <br />I don’t see my life that way, I’m too often spiritually claustrophobic. I don’t even let my imagination swing wide. I close my eyes and all I see are my eyelids. </p>

<p>Psalm 16:5 - “Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure. <em>The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance</em>. I will praise the Lord who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the Lord. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken”. </p>

<p>Why did I title this post as I did? It’s because at the fundamental level I do not count myself among the good. I’m grateful for that, I think that allows me to be a Christian more easily. </p>

<p>It’s funny writing this now, because I feel like I am in a good place currently. Feeling quite balanced. Hah! That must be <em>why</em> I am writing this. </p>

<p>A foe stands over a man near-drowned. He mocks and gloats, <br />“<em>Who will light him now?</em>” <br />The other responds - <br />“<em>I will</em>.” </p>

<p>I’m afraid I’ll lose everything. Why? Because I believe I earned all I have. What a pernicious lie. <br />Fire is an apt metaphor. <br />Water is an apt metaphor. <br />But not for the reasons I first thought.</p>
