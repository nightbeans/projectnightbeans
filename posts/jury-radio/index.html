                <p>I cannot listen to the radio. Maybe it’s because Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet and Eastenders shunned me at the ice rink when I was a kid. That’s another story. Anyway, the radio drives me mad.</p>

<p>I do not blame the DJs, it’s an impossible gig! You cannot be interesting every day from 6am to 10am - it is not possible! So, allow me to paint for you a better alternative, <em>Jury Radio</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine you knew you may be called upon at some point in your life to Radio Duty. It would be a week long, and you would be free to discuss whatever you think is most interesting. You just have to bring up interesting subjects for a week. Four hour radio slots every day for seven days. Twenty eight hours of things you are into, and you can play loads of music! </p>

<p>Here are a few of the benefits of jury radio:</p>

<p>- You have to be prepared for prolonged, engaging public speaking.</p>

<p>- You have to engage with your interests deeply enough to be able to share them with the world for twenty eight hours of audio content.</p>

<p>- You have to engage with music and figure out your taste.</p>

<p>- You do not devolve into inane nonsense or circle the same political issues entrenched in echo chambers.</p>

<p>- The public hear a wide range of people, different ages, backgrounds, beliefs and experiences, discussing with great passion <em>their thing</em>.</p>

<p>- People are considered prior to their selection for jury radio and there is a level of accountability because it is not anonymous.</p>

<p>So I put it to you, you’ve been selected for jury radio. You have one week to discuss with the nation some things that are of interest to you, the things you want to talk about and get into. What do you talk about? What guests do you bring on? Perhaps most importantly - what music do you play?</p>

<p>Let’s reclaim the radio. It’s been full of nonsense for too long.</p>

<p>Disclaimer 1: I am aware that what I’m describing may already exist and be called ‘Radio 4’</p>

<p>Disclaimer 2: I wrote this on my phone before bed. I do not think the first draft will be written especially well nor do I truly think Jury Radio is a feasible or very valuable idea. But it’s a fun thought experiment!</p>
